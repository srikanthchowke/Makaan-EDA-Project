# Makaan Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involved web scraping data from the Makaan website, a popular real estate portal in India, and performing data analysis to extract meaningful insights. The objective was to understand trends in property listings, prices, and other key metrics across different cities.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Scrape data from Makaan website.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the scraped data.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to uncover trends and patterns.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the findings using various plots and graphs.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for web scraping and data analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and extracting data.
- **Selenium**: Used for automated web browsing to handle dynamic content.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Steps

### 1. Web Scraping

Using `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium`, we scraped the following data points from property listings on the Makaan website:

- Property Type
- Location
- Price
- Area (in sq ft)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Builder/Agent Details

### 2. Data Cleaning

The raw data collected from the website was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies and missing values. This step included:

- Handling missing values
- Converting data types
- Removing duplicates
- Normalizing data formats

### 3. Data Analysis

We performed various analyses to derive insights, such as:

- **Price Distribution**: Understanding the distribution of property prices.
- **Location-Based Analysis**: Analyzing property trends in different cities and localities.
- **Size vs. Price**: Correlating the area of the property with its price.
- **Bedroom/Bathroom Analysis**: Trends based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

### 4. Visualization

Using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, we created visualizations to represent our findings, including:

- **Histograms**: For price distribution.
- **Box Plots**: To show price variation across different cities.
- **Scatter Plots**: To illustrate the relationship between property size and price.
- **Bar Charts**: For the number of properties listed by city.

## Findings

- **Price Trends**: Significant variation in property prices between different cities.
- **Hotspots**: Identified key localities with high property demand.
- **Size-Price Correlation**: Larger properties tend to be priced higher, but the correlation varies by city.
- **Market Insights**: Builders and agents with the most listings and their impact on market trends.

## Conclusion

The project successfully scraped and analyzed data from the Makaan website, providing valuable insights into the real estate market. This analysis can be useful for potential home buyers, real estate investors, and market analysts to make informed decisions.

## Future Work

- **Automation**: Automate the scraping process to update data regularly.
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Incorporate more features like property age, amenities, and neighborhood details.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to predict property prices based on various factors.
